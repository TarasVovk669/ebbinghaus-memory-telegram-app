### Description

MemoryBot is a Telegram bot designed to help users remember important information using Hermann Ebbinghaus's memory technique. Ebbinghaus discovered that 40% of new information is forgotten after 20 minutes, and 60% is forgotten after 9 hours. This phenomenon is known as the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. MemoryBot sends reminders to review information at intervals of 30 minutes, 8 hours, 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month to help consolidate knowledge into long-term memory.

### Key Features

- **Learning New Words and Terms**: The bot sends reminders to review new words at specified intervals.
- **Exam and Test Preparation**: Regular reminders help users better prepare for exams.
- **Interview Preparation**: The bot assists in remembering key points and potential answers for interviews.
- **Long-term Information Retention**: Provides a convenient way to store and review important information over time.

### Technologies

MemoryBot is built using the following technologies:

- **Spring Boot**: For developing the main application.
- **PostgresDB**: As the primary database.
- **Quartz**: For scheduling reminder tasks.
- **Chat GPT**: For processing text data and interacting with users through quizzes.

### Purpose
